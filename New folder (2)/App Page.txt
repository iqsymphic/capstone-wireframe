App Page‌ (Main!)

-User can immediately see the center, which will have some kind of...note of some kind(?)‌ 

-User presses note they are prompted =\>‌ If empty then create something to add

-If User presses on something already existing =\>‌They can either edit or delete said note

-User can also see the buttons at the top, one of them will be a log out button

-User press logout button, then they will be able to exit the app

Unsure what else to add for the moment...but will add further as I‌ build the app.
